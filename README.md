## Hi there 👋

I'm Zi Cheng, a Scientist in the Materials Science and Chemistry Department of the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), a research institute under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing software and applications for quantum algorithms in chemistry-related areas, as well as several industry projects

###  Short Biography

I obtained a BSc. (Honours) in Chemistry with a second major in Mathematics, and a PhD. focusing on Computational Chemistry at the National University of Singapore.
Before joining IHPC, I worked on modelling various molecular photophysical processes and simulating the vibronic coupling in molecules using density functional theory and GW methods.
Outside of work, I like to play badminton🏸 and jog (slowly) :runner:.
